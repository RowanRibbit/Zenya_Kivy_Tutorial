Application Development Tutorial using Kivy
- Learn how to use Kivy
- Build UIs with .py and .kv files
- Manage state in Kivy programs
- Incorporate timers, images, and user interaction
- Aim to build a simple language learning application

- Kivy is a Python Library for building applications
- Excellent for complex UIs, easy for implementing general app logic in python but hard to implement UIs easily
- Written mostly in Python, UI building is a combination of Python on Kivy
- Open source, cross platform (can build for desktop and mobile)
- GPU accelerated - good for Graphics Intensive UI

Why Kivy?
- Useful for desktop and mobile
- Very easy to build flexible and powerful UIs
- Widely used so lots of help available
- Free to use
- Easy to install and set up

How does Kivy Work?
- Layout and widget building system
- Most elements are widgets, organize widgets with layouts
- Most UI organizing done in the .kv files, and most logic handled in the .py files
- Can use variables in .kv files to keep track of state, updated automatically through properties

Learning Process
- Many options for Layouts and widgets
- Explore a few core layouts and widgets for brevity
- Build layouts and widgets with .kv and .py files
- Most logic geared towards building the application, so won't be dealing a lot with widgets that aren't associated with the app itself
- There are likely many ways to approach building the same application
- Will primarily focus on building desktop applications

# Done through https://replit.com due to issues with installing Kivy
# oh god why is one of the pictures upside down when I use the size command on itself
# something erroring in the .py file but can't figure out what it is; occured once the make_selection function was called. Copied the file from the notes and seems to work now, though can't spot the inconsistency between the two
